**Questions**

  + How can I do the same thing multiple times more efficiently in R?
  + What is vectorization?
  + Should I use a loop or an apply statement?

**Objectives**
  + Compare loops and vectorized operations.
  + Use the apply family of functions.

In R you have multiple options when repeating calculations: vectorized operations, for `loops`, and `apply` functions.

This lesson is an extension of Analyzing Multiple Data Sets. In that lesson, we introduced how to run a custom function, `analyze`, over multiple data files:

```{r LR1}
#analyze <- function(filename) {
  # Plots the average, min, and max inflammation over time.
  # Input is character string of a csv file.
#  dat <- read.csv(file = filename, header = FALSE)
#  avg_day_inflammation <- apply(dat, 2, mean)
#  plot(avg_day_inflammation)
#  max_day_inflammation <- apply(dat, 2, max)
#  plot(max_day_inflammation)
#  min_day_inflammation <- apply(dat, 2, min)
#  plot(min_day_inflammation)
#}
```
```{r LR2}
#filenames <- list.files(path = "data", pattern = "inflammation.*.csv", full.names = TRUE)
```

Vectorized Operations
A key difference between R and many other languages is a topic known as vectorization. When you wrote the `total` function, we mentioned that R already has `sum` to do this; `sum` is much faster than the interpreted `for` loop because `sum` is coded in C to work with a vector of numbers. Many of R's functions work this way; the loop is hidden from you in C. Learning to use vectorized operations is a key skill in R.

For example, to add pairs of numbers contained in two vectors

```{r LR3}
#a <- 1:10
#b <- 1:10
```

You could loop over the pairs adding each in turn, but that would be very inefficient in R.

Instead of using `i in a` to make our loop variable, we use the function `seq_along` to generate indices for each element `a` contains.

```{r LR4}
#res <- numeric(length = length(a))
#for (i in seq_along(a)) {
#  res[i] <- a[i] + b[i]
#}
```

```{r LR5}
#res
```
Instead, `+` is a vectorized function which can operate on entire vectors at once

```{r LR6}
#res2 <- a + b
```

```{r LR7}
#all.equal(res, res2)
```

## Vector Recycling
When performing vector operations in R, it is important to know about recycling. If you perform an operation on two or more vectors of unequal length, R will recycle elements of the shorter vector(s) to match the longest vector. For example:

```{r LR8}
#a <- 1:10
#b <- 1:5
```

```{r LR9}
#a + b
```
The elements of `a` and `b` are added together starting from the first element of both vectors. When R reaches the end of the shorter vector `b`, it starts again at the first element of `b` and continues until it reaches the last element of the longest vector `a`. This behaviour may seem crazy at first glance, but it is very useful when you want to perform the same operation on every element of a vector. For example, say we want to multiply every element of our vector `a` by 5:

```{r LR10}
#a <- 1:10
#b <- 5
```

```{r LR11}
#a * b
```

## for or apply?

A `for` loop is used to apply the same function calls to a collection of objects. R has a family of functions, the `apply` family, which can be used in much the same way. The `apply` family members include

  + `apply` - apply over the margins of an array (e.g. the rows or columns of a matrix)
  + `lapply` - apply over an object and return list
  + `sapply` - apply over an object and return a simplified object (an array) if possible
  + `vapply` - similar to sapply but you specify the type of object returned by the iterations

Each of these has an argument `FUN` which takes a function to apply to each element of the object. Instead of looping over `filenames` and calling `analyze`, as you did earlier, you could `sapply` over `filenames` with `FUN = analyze`:

```{r LR12,eval=FALSE,error=FALSE,echo=-1}
#sapply(filenames, FUN = analyze)
```

Deciding whether to use `for` or one of the `apply` family is really personal preference. Using an `apply` family function forces to you encapsulate your operations as a function rather than separate calls with `for`. `for` loops are often more natural in some circumstances; for several related operations, a `for` loop will avoid you having to pass in a lot of extra arguments to your function.

## Loops in R Are Slow
No, they are not! *If* you follow some golden rules:

  + 1. Don't use a loop when a vectorized alternative exists
  + 2. Don't grow objects (via `c`, `cbind`, etc) during the loop - R has to create a new object and copy across the information just to add a new element or row/column
  + 3. Allocate an object to hold the results and fill it in during the loop
  
As an example, we'll create a new version of `analyze` that will return the mean inflammation per day (column) of each file.

```{r LR13,echo=-1}
#analyze2 <- function(filenames) {
#  for (f in seq_along(filenames)) {
#    fdata <- read.csv(filenames[f], header = FALSE)
#    res <- apply(fdata, 2, mean)
#    if (f == 1) {
#      out <- res
#    } else {
      # The loop is slowed by this call to cbind that grows the object
#      out <- cbind(out, res)
#    }
#  }
#  return(out)
#}
#system.time(avg2 <- analyze2(filenames))
```

Note how we add a new column to `out` at each iteration? This is a cardinal sin of writing a `for` loop in R.

Instead, we can create an empty matrix with the right dimensions (rows/columns) to hold the results. Then we loop over the files but this time we fill in the `f`th column of our results matrix `out`. This time there is no copying/growing for R to deal with.

```{r LR15,echo=-1}
#analyze3 <- function(filenames) {
#  out <- matrix(ncol = length(filenames), nrow = 40) ## assuming 40 here from files
#  for (f in seq_along(filenames)) {
#    fdata <- read.csv(filenames[f], header = FALSE)
#    out[, f] <- apply(fdata, 2, mean)
#  }
#  return(out)
#}
#system.time(avg3 <- analyze3(filenames))
```

In this simple example there is little difference in the compute time of `analyze2` and `analyze3`. This is because we are only iterating over 12 files and hence we only incur 12 copy/grow operations. If we were doing this over more files or the data objects we were growing were larger, the penalty for copying/growing would be much larger.

Note that `apply` handles these memory allocation issues for you, but then you have to write the loop part as a function to pass to `apply`. At its heart, `apply` is just a `for` loop with extra convenience.

## Key Points

  + Where possible, use vectorized operations instead of `for` loops to make code faster and more concise.
  + Use functions such as `apply` instead of `for` loops to operate on the values in a data structure.
